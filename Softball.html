<p>I started playing softball when I was about 5 years old.</p>
<p> My dad was my coach when I was younger, and he taught me a lot of the skills that I took up to highschool.</p>
<p>I grew up with my teammates, and I honestly will never forget the memories I made with them.</p>
<p> Many years, we made it to playoffs. I am so proud of what our team accomplished.</p>
