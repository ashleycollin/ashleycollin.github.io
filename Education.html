<p>I'm a student in the Maine Business School, and I am a double major in Finance and Marketing.</p>
<p>Someday, I'd like to get my masters degree. </p>
<p>My dad owns a business, and I'd like to take over in the future.</p>
<p> Project management is something that interests me, and I might get my real estate license.</p>
In the future, I'd like to manage large scale living complexes, and aid in the process of constructing them. </p>
<p>In high school, I worked ahead and completed college and AP courses. I worked extra hard throughout high school to be the best that I could be.</p>
<p>Below is another high school student and I, who were awarded scholarships for academic excellence.</p>
